    "description-extra": "By blending <span>modern deep learning</span> with <span>classic vision algorithms</span>, the project achieves efficient and robust recognition results. YOLOv8 ensures fast vehicle detection, Sobel-based contouring enables precise plate localization, and the CNN-based OCR accurately interprets the alphanumeric characters. The system is designed for <span>real-world applications</span> such as <span>parking control, traffic surveillance, and smart city systems</span>.",
