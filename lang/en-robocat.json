    "description-main": "Robocat is an <span>autonomous quadruped robot</span> designed to <span>patrol public streets</span> and <span>monitor parking zones regulated by payment</span>. Its structure and external appearance are inspired by a cat's shape, making it functional but also friendly and approachable for pedestrians. Equipped with sensors, cameras and onboard computing, <span>Robocat can detect whether a parked vehicle has an active parking permit, combining robotics, computer vision and real-time data processing</span> to offer a smart, mobile solution for urban mobility enforcement.",
